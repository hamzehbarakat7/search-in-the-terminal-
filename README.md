to  download the libraries needed for this project on a typical Linux system (Ubuntu/Debian). You'll need to install two main libraries: libcurl for network requests and libjson-c for JSON parsing.

Here are the commands to download and install these libraries:

```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Install libcurl development files
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev

# Install json-c development files
sudo apt install libjson-c-dev
```

If you're on a different Linux distribution, the package names might be slightly different:
- For Fedora/Red Hat: 
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install libcurl-devel json-c-devel
  ```
- For Arch Linux:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S curl json-c
  ```

After installing, you can compile the program with:
```bash
gcc -o wikipedia_search main.c -lcurl -ljson-c
```

If you're on macOS, you can use Homebrew:
```bash
brew install curl
brew install json-c
```

For Windows, it's a bit more complex. You might want to:
1. Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
2. Use MinGW
3. Use a pre-compiled library like vcpkg
